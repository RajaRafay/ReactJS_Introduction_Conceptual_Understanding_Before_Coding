## 1. What is the Virtual DOM and why is it efficient?

**Virtual DOM** is a lightweight in-memory representation of the real DOM. React uses it to optimize performance when updating the UI.

**How It Works:**
- React creates a virtual DOM tree (from JSX).
- When data changes, it builds a new virtual DOM.
- React compares new virtual DOM with the previous one called **diffing**.
- It updates only the changed parts in the real DOM called **reconciliation**.

**Why Efficient?**
- Avoids unnecessary DOM manipulations.
- Batches updates for performance.
- Reduces reflows/repaints.

## 2. What happens behind the scenes when you run `npm start` in a React app?
When `npm start` runs in a React app following things happens behind the scene: 
1. Runs a development server (like Vite or Webpack Dev Server).
2. Compiles JSX to JavaScript using Babel.
3. Bundles all files.
4. Opens the app in the browser.
5. Enables Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

## 3. Why is a single HTML file enough to serve a whole React application?

React uses a single `index.html` with:

```html
<div id="root"></div>
```

- React dynamically injects all UI into this root div using **ReactDOM**.
- No need for multiple pages.
- Uses JavaScript and routing for UI updates.
- This approach avoids full page reloads, resulting in a faster and smoother user experience.

## 4. How does React manage updates to the UI?

React updates the UI by:
1. Using `state` and `props` to hold data.
2. Re-rendering components on state/prop change by generating a new Virtual DOM and comparing it with the old one.
3. Efficiently updating only changed parts without refreshing the whole page.

## 5. Compare a normal JavaScript + HTML website with a React SPA

Traditional websites built with **HTML + JavaScript** load a new HTML page every time a user navigates, causing full page reloads. In contrast, a **React SPA** loads a single HTML page once and uses JavaScript to render different views. Navigation is instant, user interactions are smoother, and performance is generally better. Additionally, React promotes reusability through components and manages state more efficiently than manipulating the DOM manually.

| Feature | Vanilla JS + HTML | React SPA |
|------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Page reload on navigation    | ✅ Yes                   | ❌ No (uses routing)            |
| UI update method             | Manual DOM manipulation | Automatic via state/props      |
| Reusability                  | ❌ Low                   | ✅ High (components)            |
| Code structure               | Script tags, global code| Modular, component-based       |
| Developer productivity       | 😵 Hard to scale         | 🚀 Easy to manage large apps    |

## 6. What is JSX and what would it look like when converted to plain JS?

**JSX (JavaScript XML)** is a syntax extension used in React to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript. It looks like HTML but is actually syntactic sugar for `React.createElement()` calls. JSX makes code more readable and expressive. However, browsers can't understand JSX directly—so **Babel** compiles it into vanilla JavaScript.

**JSX Example:**
```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello World</h1>;
```

**Plain JS Equivalent:**
```js
const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello World');
```

JSX must be compiled by Babel to standard JavaScript.

## 7. What are the benefits of component-based architecture?

**React's component-based architecture** allows developers to build encapsulated, reusable UI parts that manage their own state and logic. This modular approach improves maintainability, makes testing easier, and supports scalability. Developers can collaborate more efficiently, re-use components across projects, and build complex UIs by composing simple building blocks. It also promotes a cleaner separation of concerns between structure, behavior, and styling.

**Benefits:**
- Reusability
- Maintainability
- Separation of concerns
- Scalability
- Better team collaboration
